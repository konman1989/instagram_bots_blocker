# Instagram Bots Blocker

You can fetch, process and then block if needed bots subscribed to your Instagram account. 
Just get a cUrl for uploading all subscirbers, convert it to a Python request URL with any free online tool and
replace it in get_followers module. You can do the same in the block_followers module.

Beware that Instagram tends to block repetitive requests so play arround with the time you send each reqest.
